### What to do...

- [ ] Refactor ui handling to not explicitly require calling the RelationsManager
    - Instead use OnAdded and OnRemoved in a system for when they are created we query for that UIContainer.
    - This will require all UI entities also have a UIContainer component that has the same name as the one we want to relate to.
    - Maybe implement UINode.init(.{ components... }) and then OnAdded(UINode) to handle that in a system...
